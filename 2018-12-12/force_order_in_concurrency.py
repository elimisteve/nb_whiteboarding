12/12/2018: Problem 5

CTCI concurrency problem: Given a class that has methods `method1()`,
`method2()`, and `method3()`, each of these methods will be run on a
separate thread. Devise a mechanism where `method2()` only starts
after `method1()` is finished and `method3()` starts only after
`method2()` is finished.

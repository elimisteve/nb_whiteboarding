    Make a function that simulates getting a number from some remote computer.

    This is a reasonable simulation for testing code with threads in Python
    because delaying returning the value by making the thread sleep
    does not make the CPU do heavy work just like how doing I/O
    to get the number from a remote computer for real
    would not make the CPU do heavy work.
    (The Global Interpreter Lock in Python
    prevents code from running in parallel,
    so using threads does not speed up CPU-intensive work,
    but it does speed up I/O work since it is not done by the CPU.)
